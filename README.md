Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of developing solutions for problems in the real world using computer technology and this is done through the use of certain principles, methods and software products
it is important in the technology industry because it helps in creating software applications and sysytems that aid in various aspects of life including cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, education and entertainment

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering
1957: FORTAN, the first high level programming language was developed 
1960s: the term software engineering was coined 
2000s: the rise of agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements: this the collection of user needs
design is identifying the problem
implementation is creating a solution for the problem
testing is testing out the software that was created to solve the problem
deployment is releasing the software to users
maintenance is adding or removing feature in a software as a means of enhancing it


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall and agile are both methodologies that guide the process of software development
Also waterfall methodology is rigid and it would be appropriate in projects that have a defined or fixed timeline while agile methodolody is more flexible and would be appropriate in a project in which the requirements are expected to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team
a software developer writes codes, a quality assurance engineer ensures software quality and a project manager oversee the planning and execution of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each
IDEs are important because they provide comprehensive and detailed tools for writing. Examples:visual studio, eclipse
VCS are important because they aid in tracking and coordination. Example;subversion, Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debts as chalenges can be overcome by testing software against user requirements, regular reaccessments of projects timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance
unit testing is the testing of software components individually and it is important in the early detection of defects
integration testing is the testing of individual software components together and the interactions between them and it is important in the study of compatibility between software component
system testing is the testing of the entire software system and it is important in ensuring that the software functions correctly and free of any defects
acceptance testing is the testing of a software to ensure that it provides value to the end user and it is important because it helps in managing risk


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models
prompt engineering involves giving specific instructions when using AI and it helps the AI be more clear in giving result

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective
instead of saying write a proposal you could say write a business proposal for a health and wellness centre to be located in lagos nigeria. the improved prompt is more effective because it will give a proposal tailored specific for the business you want
